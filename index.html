      <h1><b>Concept </b>| Last.fm similar artist discovery with D3.js force directed graph modelling</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Search artist, pull Last.fm API for similar artists. 
          Last.fm will give you the similarity correlation ratio as "match" in the JSON.
        </li>
        <li>
          Render a D3.js force directed graph layout by passing the match data. 
          Implement drag functionality with corresponding physical modelling changes on every tick event of D3
        </li>
        <li>
          Use mock data first to test your model.
        </li>
        <li class="todo">
          Listen for view interactions, update model and re-render the force layout. 
          Clicking on an artist should pull Last.fm again for similar artists of that node and populate the graph with new model data
        </li>
        <li class="todo">
          When adding new nodes, loop through previous ones and merge new elements, linking the edges on common similarities.
        </li>
      </ol>
