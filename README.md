# D3.js force directed graph to find similar artists via Last.fm api

Demo: http://embed.plnkr.co/O4meBp/preview

- Search artist, pull Last.fm API for similar artists. Last.fm will give you the similarity correlation ratio as "match" in the JSON.
- Render a D3.js force directed graph layout by passing the match data. Implement drag functionality with corresponding physical modelling changes on every tick event of D3
